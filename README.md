SRT2CSV


This is a script to convert bilingual/multi-lingual subtitle file (.srt) to csv format.
It can be run in Terminal or equivelant.

You need to specify script file address, original srt file address and end csv file address.

It will divide the srt files to columns based on lines, so if you have multiple lines, it will be divided into the same amount of columns.
